So to check both frontend and backend parts of this application you need:
1. Open the backend folder
2. Run ```cp .env.example .env```
3. Fill the **OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY** (If you don't have it, I provided a key in my email to the HR) 
4. Run ```make up```
5. Open the frontend folder and open the _index.html_ file in your browser
